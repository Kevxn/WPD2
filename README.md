### Synopsis ###

A java web application with H2 databases incorporated built and managed through maven using a pom.xml file.

This application is to be used for planning and time management. This is done by setting milestones which are to be completed by a due date, with the ability to mark them complete once finished within the application.
This is a private application thus users must login to access their planners, with planner persisting after someone else has logged in.
Additional features have also been added such as sharable URL & milestone search.

##### Final System Layout #####

See figure 1.0 in group report.

##### Current Development Progress #####

Completed.

### Installation ###

Project can be installed by running git clone <git repo url> in a terminal.

### Motivation ###

We are developing this application to learn more about programming in Java  & servlets and also to learn more about developing projects in teams and using git for version control and bitbucket for collaboration. These tools are all valuable for use later on and emulate a working environment using skills that can be transferred into the workplace.
