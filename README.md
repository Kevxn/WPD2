### Synopsis ###


##### Potential Final System Layout #####



##### Current Development Progress #####

Working servlet application, updating README and other documentation.

### Code example ###


### Installation ###

Project can be installed by running git clone <git repo url> in a terminal.

### Motivation ###

We are developing the servlet to learn more about programming in Java and also to learn more about developing projects in teams and using git for version control and bitbucket for collaberation. These tools are all valuable for use later on and will also be useful for developing the integrated project too.
